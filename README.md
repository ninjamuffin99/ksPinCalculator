# ksPinCalculator

was just a cute little script / program i used to parse the big Kickstarter CSV file to get the amount of 
Kickstarter backers with both pins AND posters in some form!!

used to just count some stuff, but now I use it to format the big giant Kickstarter spreadsheet file into
more maneagable csv files!

Exports the data for WooCommerce i think is what it's called, to import into needlejuice's system!
